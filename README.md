# Metaheuristics
Optimised code from the Udemy Metaheuristics in Python course.

The code here is a reworking of the code from Dana Bani-Hani's Udemy course - Metaheuristics in Python: https://www.udemy.com/optimization-with-metaheuristics/

The code has been made into functions, and vectorised where appropriate.

This is currently a work in progress as I work through the course.
